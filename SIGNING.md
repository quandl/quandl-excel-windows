# Signing

# Open powershell as an administrator
# Navigate to code root directory
# Set the execution policy to allow unsigned scripts to run with `set-executionpolicy unrestricted`
# run `SignQuandlExcelInstaller.ps1`
# follow the instructions to sign the dlls and the installer itself (there is a break in the middle where you need to build the installer again)
